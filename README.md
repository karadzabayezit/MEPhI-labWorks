<h3 align="center">Project description</h3>
<p align="center">
	This is MEPhI project for the course "Introduction to programming in C". The projects is a simple console application that works with different types of data structures.
</p>

<p>
	To run first and second tasks you need to compile the code with the following command:
	```gcc -o task1 task1.c```
</p>

<p>
	To run other tasks you need to run scripts(bash, python, makefile). To run wiyh python, use:
	```cd project_folder/scripts
		 python run.py```
	<br/>
	Using makefile:
	```make watch```
	then go to "bin" directory, where you can run the program with:
	```./app``` (in lab 5 you can use '-h' to see what options are available).
</p>

<h3>Directory structure</h3>
<p>
'src/': Source codes.
'include/': Source codes for header files.
'scripts/': Contains Python and Bash scripts for running tasks.
'build/': Contains the object files.
'bin/': Contains the compiled executable files.
</p>
<h4>This is basic C structure.</h4>
